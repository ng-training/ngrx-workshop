# Environment setup

- Need to have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed, with npm (or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/) if you prefer)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) needs to be installed also
- Clone the workshop repo from the starting point using:

```
git clone --branch v1 https://github.com/ng-training/ngrx-workshop
```

- Install all the dependencies by going into the project folder and running install:

```
cd ngrx-workshop
npm install
```

- Check that everything works by starting the application:

```
npm start
```

- Install [Redux Devtools Extension](http://extension.remotedev.io/) for Firefox/Chrome
- Use [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) as an editor. You can use any other editor/IDE also, but we'll not have time to debug editor related issues :)
